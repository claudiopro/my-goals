# my-goals
My goals expressed as a list of todos. For better accountability, and as a reminder to myself. I tend to be very forgetful and a list of todos helps. Also I got this mindset from my IBM years :sweat_smile:. Inspired by `personal-goals` by the awesome [Una Kravets](https://github.com/una/personal-goals)
